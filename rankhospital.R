## Ranking Hospitals by Outcome in a State

# Write a function called rankhospital that takes three arguments: 
# the 2-character abbreviated name of a state (state), an outcome (outcome), 
# and the ranking of a hospital in that state for that outcome (num).
# The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a 
# character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking specified 
# by the num argument. For example, the call
# rankhospital("MD", "heart failure", 5)
# would return a character vector containing the name of the hospital with 
# the 5th lowest 30-day death rate for heart failure. The num argument can 
# take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking
# (smaller numbers are better). If the number given by num is larger than
# the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA.
# Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should
# be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.

# Handling ties. It may occur that multiple hospitals have the same 30-day 
# mortality rate for a given cause of death. In those cases ties should be 
# broken by using the hospital name (alphabetical order).
